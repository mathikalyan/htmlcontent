Tilak lent his leniency to Swaraj’s and Subhash Chandra Bose said, “Give me blood, I will give you freedom.”

At Midnight on August 15, 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru declared India as an independent country, where he delivered the speech “Trieste Destiny”. During his speech, he said, “When the world sleeps at the touch of the midnight hour, India will wake up to life and freedom. Today we ended our misfortune, and India again searched for itself.”

After this, the Assembly members vowed to give their services to the country with full integrity. Officially the National Flag was presented to the Assembly. So India became officially an independent country and Nehru and Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, respectively, became Prime Minister and Governor General. Mahatma Gandhi was not involved in this celebration. He stayed in Calcutta and ke</p>

<p>At the 1929 session of the Indian National Congress, the Purna Swaraj declaration, or "Declaration of the Independence of India" was promulgated,[7] and 26 January was declared as Independence Day in 1930.[7] The Congress called on people to pledge themselves to civil disobedience and "to carry out the Congress instructions issued from time to time" until India attained complete independence.[8] Celebration of such an Independence Day was envisioned to stoke nationalistic fervour among Indian citizens, and to force the British government to consider granting independence.[9]: 19  The Congress observed 26 January as the Independence Day between 1930 and 1946.[10][11] The celebration was marked by meetings where the attendants took the "pledge of independence".[9]: 19–20  Jawaharlal Nehru described in his autobiography that such meetings were peaceful, solemn, and "without any speeches or exhortation".[12] Gandhi envisaged that besides the meetings, the day would be spent " ... in doing some constructive work, whether it is spinning, or service of 'untouchables,' or reunion of Hindus and Mussalmans, or prohibition work, or even all these together".[13] Following actual independence in 1947, the Constitution of India came into effect on and from 26 January 1950; since then 26 January is celebrated as Republic Day</p>

<p>Independence Day, one of the three National holidays in India (the other two being the Republic Day on 26 January and Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on 2 October), is observed in all Indian states and union territories. On the eve of Independence Day, the President of India delivers the "Address to the Nation". On 15 August, the Prime Minister hoists the Indian flag on the ramparts of the historical site of Red Fort in Delhi.[1] In his speech, the Prime Minister highlights the past year's achievements, raises important issues and calls for further development. He pays tribute to the leaders of the Indian independence movement. The Indian national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana", is sung. The speech is followed by a march past of divisions of the Indian Armed Forces and paramilitary forces. Parades and pageants showcase scenes from the independence struggle and India's diverse cultural traditions. Similar events take place in state capitals where the Chief Ministers of individual states unfurl the national flag, followed by parades and pageants.[26][27] Until 1973, the Governor of the State hoisted the National Flag at the State capital. In February 1974, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi took up the issue with then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that the Chief Ministers, like the Prime Minister, should be allowed to hoist the national flag on Independence Day. Since 1974, Chief Ministers of the respective states have been allowed to hoist the national flag on Independence Day.[28][29]

Flag-hoisting ceremonies and cultural programmes take place in governmental and non-governmental institutions throughout the country.[30] Schools and colleges conduct flag hoisting ceremonies and various cultural events. Governmental and non-governmental institutions decorate their premises with paper, balloon decorations with hangings of freedom fighter portraits on their walls and major government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights.[31] In Delhi and some other cities, kite flying adds to the occasion.[32][33] National flags of different sizes are used abundantly to symbolise allegiance to the country.[34] Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories with replicas of the tri-colour.[34] Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from nationalism to a broader celebration of all things India.[35][36]

The Indian diaspora celebrates Independence Day around the world with parades and pageants, particularly in regions with higher concentrations of Indian immigrants.[37] In some locations, such as New York and other US cities, 15 August has become "India Day" among the diaspora and the local populace. Pageants celebrate "India Day" either on 15 August or an adjoining weekend day.[38]

<p>As early as three years after independence, the Naga National Council called for a boycott of Independence Day in northeast India.[39] Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations.[40] With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s,[41] separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning.[42][43][44] Terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day.[45] Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.[46][47]

In the anticipation of terrorist attacks, particularly from militants, security measures are intensified, especially in major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai and in troubled states such as Jammu and Kashmir.[48][49] The airspace around the Red Fort is declared a no-fly zone to prevent aerial attacks[50] and additional police forces are deployed in other cities.[51]

Since the assassination of Indira Gandhi, prime ministers would give their speeches from behind a bullet-proof glass panel.[52] Since 2014, when Narendra Modi was elected as prime minister, he did away with this tradition.[53] So additional intense measures were taken to ensure security.[54]</p>
